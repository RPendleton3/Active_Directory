#Downloading additional applications for group policy configuration
*A guide I wish I had, would have saved me alot of time and research

   In order to work with group policy effectively you need applications loaded onto an administrative account on a workstation to find applications on windows 11:

   Press windows key on keyboard
   Select Settings
   Select Apps
   Select Optional Features
   **See Image Group-Policy-Setup-001
   
   Click view features under Add an optional features
   Type RSAT in the search bar
   Click the checkbox for the following items:
        RSAT: Active Directory Domain Services and Lightweight Directory Service Tools
	     RSAT: Group Policy Management Tools
	     RSAT: Server Manager
   **See Image Group-Policy-Setup-002
   
   **If you do not see one or more of these on the list you can go back to the Optional Features screen and see if they have been already downloaded once selected click next and then click install
     This will take you back to the apps menu and show you the apps you are downloading
     Now if u search for the Windows Tools Folder and open it, you will see you now have afew AD programs
   **See Image Group-Policy-Setup-003
